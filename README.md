# P21031 -- Industry classification and analysis

This course aims to learn the basics of Natural Language processing within an industry project. In this course, you will learn how to extract and clean data, design a classification model from unsupervised datasets (without human labels), make accurate predictions and learn how to deploy a model into production.

During this project, you will create a system that will extract information about a company from the web to predict its industry. Then, after knowing its industry, you will learn how to run business analytics on people in that industry compare to other sectors to give meaningful insights for several departments in a company. 

## Requirements

In this project, I will give you all the ingredients you need to build your model. This course is for beginner to intermediate coders. You can create a simple solution that will answer the requirements or a more complex system that can give more accuracy, reliability.

You will need basic knowledge of Python to understand most of the content of the project efficiently. 

You will run each course and exercise on Deepnote. This tool/website will allow you to run code quickly without setting up your environment in your machine.

Each video will be available on Youtube for you to follow after each class.

## What you will learn in this course

This course will give you a condensed knowledge of an unsupervised classification problem. Unsupervised learning appears when you don't have labels to train a machine on but rely on other aspects of the data to make predictions. 

In this course, you will learn to extract data from an API, clean that data to make it easier to process. You will also learn how to transform this data, design a model that will help you classify a company into a specific industry.

In addition to working on the model, you will learn how to create data insight relevant for the business to sell a solution—for example, creating a friendly interface for analysts to work on your data.



## Steps of the project

### Phase 1: Data extraction and cleaning - 3 courses + videos

In this phase, you will learn how to use an API to extract information from a 3rd party application. You will also learn to clean a text dataset to avoid working with noisy observations in your system.

From this phase, you will create the following code/system:
- Having a scraping script that will extract information by making sure that you minimize cost.
- Create tests to make sure that your extraction pipeline works
- Creating and populating a dataset used for your model.
- Create a data cleaning pipeline to make sure that your dataset isn't too noisy to process.

### Phase 2: Model design - 4 courses + videos

In this phase, you will learn different approaches to design a model that will rely on unclassified data. You will learn the basics of topic classification, unsupervised sentence classification, and vectorization of words. After this phase, you will be able to apply these techniques in different fields of sentence classification.

From this phase, you will create the following code/system:
- A prediction pipeline that transforms a company description and predicts its industry.
- Different models design on how to represent and classify information using words.
- Evaluate the performance of your model and understanding the weaknesses and advantages for each of them.

### Phase 3: Data Analytics - 2 courses + videos

For this phase, you will learn how to extract meaningful data analytics from market information. You will be able to give insightful knowledge on comparing industries by using metrics relevant to your analysts.

From this phase, you will have:
- Set of functions to transform business data into meaningful information.
- The final dataset use to presenting the analysis of the business.

### Phase 4: Web UI - 4 courses + videos

For this final phase, you will learn how to deliver a product to non-technical people—making sure that individuals can interact with your findings and that they make the best use of your information.

From this phase, you will have:
- A running website that reads and presents the analysis.
- A complete code base to present as one of your projects
