You will discover several techniques to represent a document into something that a model can processâ€”learning from the primary count vectorizer to the more complex Tfidf, their differences, and what makes each of them better for a specific use case. We will also cover some data cleaning approaches to avoid treating noise or unnecessary information in our observations.\n",
