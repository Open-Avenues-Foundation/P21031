# Phase 1: Data extraction and cleaning - 3 courses + videos

In this phase, you will learn how to use an API to extract information from a 3rd party application. You will also learn to clean a text dataset to avoid working with noisy observations in your system.

From this phase, you will create the following code/system:
- Having a scraping script that will extract information by making sure that you minimize cost.
- Create tests to make sure that your extraction pipeline works
- Creating and populating a dataset used for your model.
- Create a data cleaning pipeline to make sure that your dataset isn't too noisy to process.
