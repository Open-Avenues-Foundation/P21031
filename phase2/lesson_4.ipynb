    "In this final lesson, I will walk you through alternatives to the model we designed and see how it compares. Next, we will cover old unsupervised methods that are successful in modeling topics in a vast set of observations. Then, we will see how to compare performances and find the advantages and weaknesses of each model. Finally, I will present to you what is currently done in Data science, especially in Natural Language Processing, to classify documents without labels.\n",
