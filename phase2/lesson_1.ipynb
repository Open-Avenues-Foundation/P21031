    "In this lesson, we will learn the basics of data representation. You will discover several techniques to represent a document into something that a model can processâ€”learning from the primary count vectorizer to the more complex Tfidf, their differences, and what makes each of them better for a specific use case. We will also cover some data cleaning approaches to avoid treating noise or unnecessary information in our observations.\n",

We will be discovering how to represent the information to be understood by the machine quickly and find the best method to gain accuracy. You will develop an independent pipeline that will take text as input and give you the closer industry related to your input information during this stage."
